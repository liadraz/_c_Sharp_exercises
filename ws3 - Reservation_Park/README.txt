# General

Your client is a natural reservation park with thousands of daily travelers. 
Travelers can be families, singles or groups of elderly citizens. Travelers leave their details in the park entrance. 
The park has a weather center which constantly monitors the weather to predict storms (storm Intensity ranges between 0-10). 
When the weather center detects a coming storm, it alerts the travelers. Each traveler (or traveler group) behaves (le, prints to the console) differently in case of a storm. 
Behavior can also vary depending on the storm intensity.

# Requirements

* Make a class diagram of the different classes and interfaces. Strive for code reusability on loose coupling of different classes.
* Make a console application which describes a day in the park-some visitors enter, some leave, and every once in a while a storm is alerted.
